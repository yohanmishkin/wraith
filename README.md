# wraith
A server-side mock client to develop, test and prototype your REST-api

## Build, test, and demo your app using a server-side client

### Productive
Spend less time wiring up HttpClient, and get back to developing your api.

### Test-worthy
Use factories to define your client's state per test. Acceptance testing just got a whole lot easier.

### Shareable
Share a functional prototype of your app that runs entirely in the server - before writing a single line of your Client.
